"Test 1: synthetic data generated for camera distance 20 to 200 cm, camera angle -60 to 60 deg, light intensity 10 to 2000. 20 values taken for each variable results in 20x20x20=8000 test images per logo",,,,,,,
Test 2: real data gathered by taking photos of a real pringles can and bottle of dettol soap. Currently has 253 images,,,,,,,
